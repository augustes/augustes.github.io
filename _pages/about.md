Welcome to my personal website! I am in the process of building it and a lot of content is still from the al-folio template and Einstein's, not my achievements. 

I am currently doing my PhD at the intersection of machine learning and neuroscience with [Jakob Macke](https://www.mackelab.org/) at the AI Center in Tübingen, Germany.

My research focuses on machine learning method development for neuroscience to link high-dimensional brain data and complex behavior. 

Before switching to ML for neuroscience during my PhD:
- I studied **Physics** at Heidelberg and London (UCL) with a focus on particle physics
- I did my masters in **Neuroengineering** at TU Munich.

**Communicating science** is almost as important to me as 'doing' science, especially since I started working in Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence. AI is set out to influence so many aspects of our lives in the coming years, and it is vital that the general public understands and is capable of shaping this technology. I am therefore very happy to be part of the fantastic initiative, [KI macht Schule](https://ki-macht-schule.de/), which brings AI education into schools. 

I believe that a just AI future, one that is representative and equitable, can only be realized by amplifying diverse voices. I am therefore working towards:
<!-- To ensure a future with AI that is just and serves more interests than just that of a few, we need to bring more voices to the table and foster inclusivity in science. I am therefore working towards: -->
- Promoting stronger representation of underrepresented groups in Machine Learning and STEM.
- Increasing accessibility for individuals from non-academic backgrounds.
- Motivating more girls to delve into STEM disciplines and ensuring women play essential roles in steering this domain.
